# Bike Sharing Data Analysis (Capstone Project)

This project analyzes the **Bike Sharing dataset** (2011â€“2012, Washington D.C.) to identify patterns in bike rentals and provide business recommendations.

## Dataset
Source: [Kaggle - Bike Sharing Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakshmi25npathi/bike-sharing-dataset)  
File used: `day.csv` (~730 days of daily rental data)

## Tools
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)
- Google Colab

## Steps
1. Load and clean dataset
2. Explore daily/weekly rental patterns
3. Analyze correlation with temperature and weather
4. Compare working days vs weekends
5. Provide business recommendations

## Findings
- Rentals are highest on weekdays (especially Thursday and Friday), lowest on Sundays.
- Positive correlation between temperature and rentals (demand rises in warmer weather).
- Working days show slightly higher rentals than weekends (commuting effect).

## Recommendations
- Increase bike availability on weekdays (especially Thuâ€“Fri).
- Run marketing campaigns in spring/summer.
- Offer discounts during bad weather.
- Use Sundays (lowest demand) for maintenance and redistribution.
